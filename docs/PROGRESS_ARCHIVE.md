## 2026-06-28 — Dev environment setup

Fixed `python`/`pip` not recognized: added Python 3.10.7 (`C:\Users\guilh\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\` + its `Scripts\`) to User PATH; pinned as workspace interpreter in `.vscode/settings.json`. Fixed `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` from Avast intercepting HTTPS — appended Avast root cert to both `certifi` cacert.pem files. `pip install -r requirements.txt` now succeeds (new terminals only — already-open terminals won't pick up PATH change). S1 scaffold partially done (folders, `.gitignore`, `requirements.txt`, `src/data_loader.py` + module stubs) — notebook 01 still pending.

---

## 2026-06-29 — S1 + S2 + S3

**S1:** Notebook 01 ran clean; bonus mplsoccer shot map (all outcomes Goal/Saved/Blocked/Off T/Wayward explicitly coloured).

**S2** (`src/features.py`): distance/angle computed from goalpost geometry (StatsBomb pitch, posts at y=36/44); assist type derived by joining `shot_key_pass_id` to source pass event. Hit real bug: `pass_cross`/`pass_through_ball`/`pass_cut_back` hold `True`/`NaN` — `bool(NaN)` is `True` in Python, so ~72% of assists misclassified as crosses; fixed with explicit `is True` checks.

**S3** (`src/models.py`, `src/visualisation.py`, notebook 02): logistic regression on Leverkusen 2023/24 + PL 2015/16 (10,824 shots, 10.1% conversion), tested on EURO 2024 (1,340 shots) — ROC-AUC 0.786 train / 0.798 test. Cached to `data/shots_*.pkl`. Flagged `assist_type` dummy-variable collinearity for S4. Nothing committed yet.

---

## 2026-06-29 (cont.) — S4

Fixed assist-type collinearity (drop "None" as reference category). Added `train_gradient_boosting()`: tuning sweep; even tuned, GBM (train 0.796/test 0.793) didn't beat logistic (0.786/0.798) — **logistic stays as recommended model**. Added `get_feature_importance()`, `build_player_xg_table()`, `plot_player_xg_ranking()`. Rebuilt cache with `competition_id` column to isolate PL 2015/16 from Leverkusen for the era-benchmark ranking. PL 2015/16 ranking passes sniff test: Agüero/Mahrez/Kane top overperformers, Mitrović/Bony/Jerome top underperformers. Added Learning Goals section to CLAUDE.md. S1–S4 committed.

---

## 2026-06-29 (cont.) — S5

`src/similarity.py`: minutes from StatsBomb `lineups` endpoint (more reliable than reconstructing from Starting XI + Substitution events — `lineups` tracks Tactical Shift position changes directly). Built per-90 event metrics for PL 2015/16 — 300 players at 900-min floor (118 Def / 104 Mid / 78 Fwd; GKs excluded). Hit sparse-column gotcha: `pass_goal_assist` missing from matches with zero assists — fixed with `_safe_bool_column`/`_safe_column` helpers. SkillCorner physical metrics derived from frame-to-frame position deltas; `min_observed_minutes=30` caps extrapolation at 3×. Confirmed zero player overlap between StatsBomb and SkillCorner datasets. Cached `data/player_per90_pl_2015_16.pkl`. S5 committed separately.

---

## 2026-06-29 (cont.) — S6

Added clustering to `similarity.py` and plotting to `visualisation.py`. Key design: **clustering per position group** (not across all outfield players — would just rediscover position). K=4 per group. Results: midfielder cluster Kanté/M'Vila/Gueye/Drinkwater (ball-winning destroyer, anchored by Kanté's title-winning Leicester season); Özil/Fàbregas/Lallana (creative playmaker, Özil's record-assist season); defender cluster Cresswell/Daniels/Bellerín/van Aanholt (overlapping full-backs). One-man defender cluster: Michail Antonio with absurd z-scores (+5.95 goals/90) — documented as labelling limitation, not a clustering bug. Notebook 03 runs clean.

---

## 2026-06-29 (cont.) — S7 + S8

**S7:** `find_similar_players()` — Euclidean distance in standardised space, within position group (continuous ranking, not just cluster membership). `plot_player_radar()` — mplsoccer Radar, axes at 5th-95th percentile. Hit StatsBomb quirk: Kanté stored as `N''Golo Kanté` (doubled apostrophe). Hit mplsoccer gotcha: `Radar.setup_axis` expects plain rectangular `Axes`, not polar (see `docs/ML_TOOLING.md`). Validated: Kanté → Gueye/Tioté/Coquelin/Fernando; Cresswell → Brunt/Davies/Sagna/Bertrand/Daniels; Kane → Vardy/Carroll/Ighalo/Defoe/Agüero. Added Theoretical Concepts Reference and Module C/PUP spec to ML_LEARNING_LOG.md.

**S8:** Replaced placeholder README.md with full project narrative — module framing, honest numbers, embedded PNGs, honest caveats (GBM non-win, Antonio cluster). S6/7/8 committed and pushed ("S6/7 - Radar charts + visuals + final polish + README"). All S1–S8 pushed.

---

## 2026-06-29 (cont. 7) — Phase 0 + Phase 1 complete

Kicked off Framework Hardening initiative. **Phase 0:** `docs/FRAMEWORK.md` charter + `docs/INITIATIVE.md` tracker. **Phase 1:** `src/config.py` (named `Dataset` constants replacing magic id tuples); per-match pickle cache in `data_loader.py`; **correctness fix — penalty-shootout shots (period 5) dropped in `extract_shot_features`** (~75% conversion was inflating EURO test set); null-location guard; `plot_shot_map` ax fix. Pinned `requirements.txt` (+pyarrow, pytest). Added `tests/` with 14 green unit tests (incl. truthy-NaN assist regression test). Notebook 02 rewired to config constants. Committed (`a3ff7cd`).

---

## 2026-06-30 — Parquet cache migration + kernel fix

Migrated notebook-02 shot caches to Parquet (flat tables are parquet-safe; raw per-match cache stays pickle). Rebuilt caches through the fixed pipeline — **penalty-shootout fix confirmed: EURO test 1,340→1,316 shots, test ROC-AUC 0.798→0.765** (honest number on in-game shots only). Updated README to 0.765. Fixed IDE Jupyter kernel (was defaulting to conda base Python 3.9.12): filtered via `.vscode/settings.json` `jupyter.kernels.filter`, normalized all three notebooks' kernelspec to portable `python3`.

---

## 2026-06-30 (cont.) — Phase 2 Module A (xG rigor) complete

Four rigor checks in `src/models.py` + notebook 02, all narrated:
1. **Scaled logistic** — Pipeline/ColumnTransformer; test ROC-AUC essentially unchanged (0.765) — the lesson is clean convergence + comparable coefficients (`distance_to_goal` −0.10 raw → −0.84 per-SD).
2. **5-fold CV** — 0.783 ± 0.009 in-distribution; EURO test (0.765) at bottom edge → real ~1.7-pt league→tournament cost.
3. **Baseline ladder** — no-skill 0.500 → geometry-only 0.712 → full 0.765. ~80% of discrimination is pure shot geometry.
4. **Calibrated GBM** (isotonic) — Brier 0.0661→0.0659, basically nothing; still trails logistic. "Logistic stays" survives a harder test.

New helpers: `build_logistic_pipeline`, `get_coefficients`, `cross_validate_model`, `train_baseline_classifier`, `train_calibrated_gbm`. +5 tests (19 green). Notebook 02 re-run clean. Committed (`bbc4ac8`).

---

## 2026-06-30 (cont.) — Phase 2 Module B (similarity rigor) complete → Phase 2 done

Two additions to `src/similarity.py` + notebook 03 + `visualisation.py`:

**Silhouette score** (`compute_silhouette_scores`, `plot_silhouette_curve`): peaked at K=2 for all three groups but at low absolute values (Defender 0.236 / Mid 0.264 / Fwd 0.262). Low value is the finding — play-styles within a position are a **continuum**, not crisp blobs. K=4 kept deliberately against the metric for archetype granularity, narrated honestly.

**Minutes-weighted position** (`resolve_season_positions`): assigns group by total season minutes, not modal match slot. Reclassified 10 borderline hybrids (Coutinho/Lingard/Mata/Sissoko Forward→Mid, Firmino/Berahino Mid→Forward, Schlupp Mid→Defender, …); counts 118/104/78 → 119/106/75. Did **not** move Michail Antonio — his real minutes are 920 RB/wing-back vs 761 wing, so the fix correctly keeps him a Defender. He's a true positional hybrid; no single-position rule can resolve that.

+3 tests (22 green). Per-90 cache rebuilt. Notebook 03 re-run clean. New `outputs/similarity_silhouette_curves.png`. Committed (`5e5aaef`).

---

## 2026-07-01 — .md restructure

Restructured all .md docs into modular files (none >200 lines). Rewrote CLAUDE.md as lean index (~130 lines). Split ML_LEARNING_LOG.md into: itself (gotchas/decisions log, ~100 lines) + docs/ML_THEORY.md (textbook theory) + docs/ML_TOOLING.md (env gotchas). Created docs/CONTEXT.md (owner/learning goals/career), docs/DATA.md (data sources/cache index), docs/MODULES.md (Module A/B/C specs), docs/ROADMAP.md (session table + Phase 3 scope), docs/PROGRESS.md (this file's parent), docs/PROGRESS_ARCHIVE.md (S1-S8 history). Added .claudeignore (excludes data/, outputs/, __pycache__, binary files). INITIATIVE.md and FRAMEWORK.md kept as-is (already ≤200 lines).

---

## 2026-07-01 — Phase 5 product-layer spec expanded (no build)

Expanded the thin Phase 5 lead (one ASCII sketch in FRAMEWORK.md) into a full interface spec: new `docs/PRODUCT_SPEC.md`. Covers the one-screen design (two lenses — similarity/scouting + xG/valuation), interaction model (sidebar selectors + customizable radar-axis multiselect), a **component→backend reuse map** (every panel powered by an existing tested `src/` function — no new chart code), precomputed-Parquet data flow (`app_data/`, no live StatsBomb pulls), tech decision (**Streamlit** chosen; Dash + static-site rejected with reasons), out-of-scope list, a turnkey build checklist, and ASCII mockups. FRAMEWORK.md product stub now links the spec; INITIATIVE.md + ROADMAP.md Phase 5 marked 🟡 spec-done/build-pending. Docs only — no app code, no model change, 22 tests untouched. Committed (`4be7844`).

---

## 2026-07-02 — Reprioritisation + de-drift (planning only)

"Do it all, structured." Folded the whole code-review backlog into one execution-ordered program and **renumbered the initiative to Phases 0–9**. New **Phase 3 = engineering & reproducibility spine** (CI, `pipeline.py`, `metrics.json` single-source, data manifest) — promoted ahead of data expansion (Phase 4) because the manifest is a prerequisite of the ingestion pipeline and `metrics.json` must exist before we 10× the data/numbers. Old Phase 3 (360 xG) → **Phase 7**; old Phase 5 (Streamlit build) → **Phase 8**; old Phase 6 + Module C → **Phase 9** (opportunistic). Added **Phase 5** (xG uncertainty + hierarchical/empirical-Bayes finishing, header/foot interaction, calibration by stratum) and **Phase 6** (Module B: Mahalanobis distance, possession-adjusted actions, GMM soft membership, richer creative features).

**De-drift in the same pass:** the phase table now lives **only** in INITIATIVE.md (ROADMAP links to it + holds the detailed per-phase task lists); the stale "all uncommitted" note here was corrected against git log (Phases 0–2 + restructure + product spec are committed — `a3ff7cd`/`bbc4ac8`/`5e5aaef`/`4be7844`); CLAUDE.md Current Status + MODULES.md forward-pointers updated. Docs only — no `src/`, notebook, test, or data changes; 22 tests untouched. Committed (`e862a59`).

---

## 2026-07-02 — Phase 3 spine, Checkpoints A+B (CI + data manifest)

First code of the engineering & reproducibility spine.

**Checkpoint A — CI:** `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs the suite on push/PR to main (Python 3.10 to match the pinned `requirements.txt`, `MPLBACKEND=Agg` so `visualisation.py`'s import-time matplotlib works headless). CI badge added to README (repo slug `GuiPadinha/football-analytics-portfolio`). Also cleared the 3a leftover: renumbered the two `src/config.py` comments that still called the 360 model "Phase 3" → Phase 7. *Push required for the badge to go live / first run to appear.*

**Checkpoint B — data manifest (3e):** new `src/manifest.py` + `tests/test_manifest.py`. `python -m src.manifest` writes `data/manifest.json` (tracked via a new `.gitignore` exception) pinning, per dataset, the sorted match-id set + a short set-hash + local cache coverage, plus content hashes of the two processed `shots_*.parquet` tables. Deliberately timestamp-free → pure function of the data, so only real drift diffs. Generated for real: **3 datasets, 465 matches pinned (380 PL 2015/16 + 51 EURO 2024 + 34 Leverkusen), all cached locally**; `statsbombpy 1.19.0` recorded. Feeds Phase 4's ingestion pipeline.

Tests **22 → 27 green** (+5 manifest tests, all network-free via an injected loader). Committed (`6a1876c`).

**Remaining in Phase 3 (at the time):** 3b (`metrics.json` single-source for key numbers) + 3d (`pipeline.py`/Makefile headless rebuild).

---

## 2026-07-02 — Phase 3 spine, Checkpoint C (3b: metrics.json single source)

Closed the drift vector the whole reprioritisation was about: headline numbers were hand-typed into four docs and had already drifted once (the 0.798→0.765 penalty-fix took four edits to chase).

**New `src/metrics.py`** computes them from the same code/data the models use — xG train/test ROC-AUC + Brier, in-distribution CV mean±std, the no-skill→geometry→full baseline ladder, per-group silhouette peaks, and shot counts — and `python -m src.metrics` writes the committed **`metrics.json`** (repo root, outside gitignored `data/`; deterministic + timestamp-free like the manifest). Split into pure compute (`compute_xg_metrics` / `compute_similarity_metrics` / `build_metrics`, tested on synthetic frames) and an IO wrapper (`write_metrics`) so the unit tests stay offline. **Every emitted value matched the docs on the first run** (0.765 / 0.786 / 0.783±0.009 / 0.5→0.712→0.765 / silhouette 0.236·0.264·0.262 at K=2 / 10,824 · 1,316) — the docs were honest, they just weren't *enforced*.

**Doc-lint** (`tests/test_metrics.py::test_current_state_docs_match_metrics_json`): fails the build if a *current-state* doc (README/CLAUDE/MODULES/DATA) prints a number that differs from `metrics.json`. Append-only history (PROGRESS, INITIATIVE log entries, ML_LEARNING_LOG, the archive) is deliberately exempt — an old dated entry may keep the 0.798 it reported then. Deferred the test-count number (a repo fact, not a model output). Docs now *reference* the file: README callout under the results table, CLAUDE.md key-numbers note, ROADMAP 3b marked done.

Tests **27 → 31 green** (+3 pure-compute, +1 doc-lint). Committed (`102a134`).

**Remaining in Phase 3 (at the time):** 3d (`pipeline.py`/Makefile headless rebuild).

---

## 2026-07-03 — Phase 3 spine, Checkpoint D (3d: pipeline.py + Makefile) → Phase 3 complete

Closed the last Phase 3 checkpoint. New **`src/pipeline.py`** chains the already-tested `src/` functions into a headless, non-notebook rebuild — mirrors notebooks 02/03 exactly rather than reimplementing them: build/reload the xG shot tables and the per-90 similarity table (skip the raw StatsBomb pull when the `data/` cache already exists, same `REBUILD` logic the notebooks use), train the logistic + GBM models and write all 4 Module A output PNGs, cluster each position group (K=4, matching the Phase 2 silhouette call) and write all 4 Module B output PNGs, then call `write_manifest()`/`write_metrics()` last (order matters — metrics.json reads the tables the earlier steps just built). Runnable as `python -m src.pipeline`, with `--force` (bypass caches, re-pull raw data) and `--skip-plots` (data + manifest/metrics only) flags.

A thin root **`Makefile`** wraps it (`make pipeline`, `make pipeline-force`, `make test`) for anyone with `make` on their PATH — confirmed it isn't on this Windows machine (checked both PowerShell and Git Bash), so `python -m src.pipeline` stays the primary, always-works entry point; the Makefile is a convenience for CI/WSL/Linux contributors, not a requirement.

**Verified for real, not just unit-tested:** ran `python -m src.pipeline` end-to-end against the existing local `data/` cache (no `--force`, so no fresh network pull) — reproduced `metrics.json` and `data/manifest.json` **byte-for-byte** (`git status` showed no diff on either), which is the concrete proof the pipeline is a faithful non-interactive twin of the notebooks rather than a rewrite that happens to look similar. All 8 output PNGs regenerated cleanly.

+5 unit tests (`tests/test_pipeline.py`) — the one piece of genuinely new logic (rebuild-vs-reuse cache decisions in `build_shot_tables`/`build_similarity_table`), tested network-free via monkeypatched builders, same pattern as `test_manifest.py`. Tests **31 → 36 green**. Committed as part of `ce45e74` (bundled with `ARCHITECTURE.md` + docs cleanup in that session's single commit).

**Phase 3 (engineering & reproducibility spine) is now fully done. Next: Phase 4 (multi-competition ingestion + data expansion).**

---

## 2026-07-04 — docs pass: git policy, ARCHITECTURE.md, SofaScore/FlashScore note

Guilherme is showing the repo to a friend and flagged two things: wanted the git-CLI-forbidden rule
relaxed (he'd only used GitHub Desktop because he thought I couldn't run git; I can), and wanted
more infra-level documentation of how `src/` actually fits together.

**Git policy relaxed:** CLAUDE.md's Session Workflow no longer says GitHub-Desktop-only; `git
status`/`log`/`diff`/`add`/`commit` are fine to run directly (still: only commit when asked, no
force-push, prefer new commits over amends — the normal global caution, not a project-specific one).

**New `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`:** the module dependency graph CLAUDE.md's one-line-per-file layout
never had. Built from the actual `grep "from src"` import graph, not guessed — two things stood
out enough to call out explicitly: `models.py`/`visualisation.py` import nothing from `src/`
(dataset-agnostic, work for whatever DataFrame a caller hands them), and `features.py`/
`similarity.py` don't import `config.py` either (they take ids/`Dataset` objects as parameters —
only `manifest.py`/`metrics.py`/`pipeline.py` pin down *which* competitions via `config.py`
defaults). Also documents the DataFrame-schema contracts an import graph can't show (e.g.
`models.build_feature_matrix` hard-assumes column names `features.py` produces, with no shared
type checking it) and the pure-compute/IO-wrapper split `manifest.py`/`metrics.py` both use (why
the test suite stays offline). Cross-linked from CLAUDE.md's docs list; closes the Phase 9
backlog item flagged earlier the same day.

**DATA.md gap closed** (found while verifying doc consistency at Guilherme's request): the two
committed provenance/metrics files (`metrics.json`, `data/manifest.json`) were never documented
there — added a short table. Also added a **candidate alternative data source** note: SofaScore/
FlashScore match-info as a fallback if Phase 4's StatsBomb availability friction bites — with the
honest caveat that it's match-level/box-score data (no per-shot x/y), so it can't replace StatsBomb
for Module A, but could supply the external match-importance/standings labels Module C (PUP) has
been blocked on since it was scoped. Cross-linked from ROADMAP Phase 4d and MODULES.md's PUP spec.

Docs only — no `src/`, notebook, test, or data changes; 36 tests untouched. Committed as part of
`ce45e74`.

---

## 2026-07-04 (cont.) — doc-style cleanup: concept headers over narrative, paragraphs over crammed bullets

Guilherme flagged a recurring style issue across the docs: section headers written as narrative/
rhetorical framing ("Why this exists", "Who it's for") instead of direct concept labels, and bullet
points in PRODUCT_SPEC.md/ARCHITECTURE.md that were really 2+ sentences of connected reasoning
squeezed into one bullet rather than written as prose. Confirmed scope and direction with him first
(3 quick questions) rather than guessing across ~10 files: fix applies to all conceptual docs except
README (deliberately pitch-styled per CONTEXT.md's portfolio-framing policy); dated log entries in
PROGRESS/PROGRESS_ARCHIVE/ML_LEARNING_LOG get a soft touch only, keeping their day-to-day detail;
headers should stay short *phrases*, not compressed to single words that lose the "how/why" framing
(e.g. "How the Modules Combine", not "Module Interaction").

**FRAMEWORK.md** and **PRODUCT_SPEC.md** got the heaviest rewrite: renamed headers ("Why this
exists" → "Purpose", "Who it's for" → "Audience", "The one screen" → "Screen Layout", "Explicitly
NOT in scope (so we stop wondering)" → "Out of Scope", etc.) and trimmed conversational asides in
the intro prose ("This is the part where the user inputs something..." → a direct statement of what
the input is). Structured spec-sheet bullets (Input/What happens/Output/Decision-it-informs) were
left as bullets — that's parallel-field structure, not the narrative-bullet problem.

**ARCHITECTURE.md**: converted the "Implicit contracts" bullet pair (each one really 2-3 sentences
of connected reasoning about one schema dependency) into two prose paragraphs, per the fix
previewed and approved before the rewrite. Renamed a few headers to drop rhetorical parentheticals
("Import graph (who actually imports whom)" → "Import Graph") and standardised header capitalisation
across the file.

**CONTEXT.md, MODULES.md, DATA.md, ROADMAP.md, CLAUDE.md**: reviewed, no changes needed — already
concept-first with appropriately short/parallel bullets, not the flagged pattern.

**INITIATIVE.md**: two inline bold lead-ins echoed the same narrative-question pattern at
paragraph level ("**Why this initiative exists:**", "**Why the spine goes first (over the earlier
...)**") — reworded to "**Origin:**" and "**Sequencing rationale:**". Its dated "Log" section is
left alone, same reasoning as PROGRESS.md.

**PROGRESS.md / PROGRESS_ARCHIVE.md / ML_LEARNING_LOG.md**: reviewed under the "soft touch, keep
day-to-day detail" instruction — headers are already dated/factual (not the rhetorical-question
pattern) and bullets are one-gotcha-per-item, not multi-idea crams, so left unchanged rather than
edited for the sake of it.

Verified no stale cross-references after the header renames (grepped for every renamed heading's
old text and the one line-number anchor link that pointed into FRAMEWORK.md); full suite re-run,
36/36 still green, doc-lint untouched since none of the changed prose overlaps a `metrics.json`-
checked number. Docs only. Committed as part of `ce45e74`.

---

## 2026-07-04 (cont.) — quick experiment: does more league volume help xG generalisation? + obstacle-doc gaps closed

Guilherme asked three things before signing off: what obstacles this session hit and whether they're
documented, whether there's any evidence yet that the Phase 4 data actually helps the model, and
whether the non-shooting event data (passing, positioning, tackling) is being used anywhere.

**Obstacle docs:** most of the session's real obstacles were already logged (sparse-column crash →
ML_LEARNING_LOG.md/ARCHITECTURE.md; La Liga-is-mostly-Barcelona → DATA.md). Three weren't: Git Bash's
lack of network egress (PowerShell has it), a background pull's stdout-redirect hiding output from the
harness's own tracker, and the Serie A 2015/16 `IncompleteRead` transient pull failure. All three added
to ML_TOOLING.md, plus a "How to use this file" footer and a CLAUDE.md end-of-session checklist line
so this gets logged as it happens, not retrospectively.

**Non-shooting data:** Module B already uses it (`ACTION_COLUMNS` in `similarity.py` — key passes,
progressive passes, dribbles, pressures, interceptions, tackles — per-90 for player similarity).
xA/chance-creation (passing) and 360-context xG (positioning) are already scoped, unstarted backlog
items (Phase 9 / Phase 7). Flagged one new idea not yet on the roadmap: a possession-value
(VAEP/xT-style) model that scores every event, not just shots/completed passes — the real answer to
"value a tackle," a bigger lift than xA, Phase 9+ candidate.

**Quick retraining experiment** (scratch script, not committed — `phase4_train_expansion_experiment.py`):
same logistic pipeline, same untouched EURO 2024 test set, three training sets built from already-cached
Phase 4 data. Result:

| Training set | Shots | Test ROC-AUC | Test Brier |
|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline (Leverkusen+PL 2015/16) | 10,824 | 0.7654 | 0.0651 |
| + La Liga/Serie A/Ligue 1 2015/16 | 38,804 | 0.7662 | 0.0656 |
| + all 16 Barcelona seasons too | 50,789 | 0.7678 | 0.0659 |

Test ROC-AUC creeps up ~0.1–0.2 points per data addition — smaller than the ±0.009 fold-to-fold noise
the Phase 2 CV already measured, so not distinguishable from noise. Test Brier gets marginally *worse*
each time even as train ROC-AUC rises more (0.786→0.804→0.803): the added shots fit the training
distribution better without transferring to the out-of-distribution tournament test. Reads as
confirmation, not contradiction, of the earlier CV finding — the league→tournament shift is
structural, not a sample-size problem, so raw volume alone won't close it. Caveat: naive pooling, no
cross-league normalisation — Phase 4b's real version needs that before this is a final verdict; this
was a smoke test to answer "does it help at all," not the production wiring decision.

Docs only (`ML_TOOLING.md`, `CLAUDE.md` end-of-session checklist) + this log entry — the experiment
script itself is scratch, not part of the repo. 41 tests untouched. Also added to
[ML_LEARNING_LOG.md](../ML_LEARNING_LOG.md)'s Module A gotcha list. Committed as part of `0d4d2fe`.

---

## 2026-07-04 (cont.) — +10 tests (model input/output/functioning validation) + Module A→B→C ordering pass

Guilherme asked for tests validating the models more directly (input/output/functioning/features,
beyond the existing unit tests), and to standardise on telling the module story as A→B→C everywhere
(narration and docs), reserving a lead-with-B exception for contexts where it genuinely reads better
(e.g. the recruitment walkthrough in FRAMEWORK.md, left as B→A since that's the real workflow order).

**New `tests/test_contracts.py`** (3 tests): pins the schema contracts `ARCHITECTURE.md` describes
but nothing previously enforced — `extract_shot_features`'s output covers every column
`build_feature_matrix` needs, `ASSIST_TYPES` covers every category `_classify_assist` can produce,
and `PER90_FEATURE_COLUMNS` stays a pure function of `ACTION_COLUMNS` rather than a second
hand-maintained list.

**Domain sanity checks** (`test_models.py`, +3): a closer shot must get higher predicted xG than a
farther one, a penalty must get higher predicted xG than an otherwise-identical open-play shot, and
`build_player_xg_table` aggregates shots/goals/xg_diff correctly — invariants a metric like ROC-AUC
can't directly guarantee (a model can rank well on average while getting an individual comparison
backwards).

**Coverage gaps closed:** `game_state_score_diff` reflects the score *before* a shot's own goal is
credited, not after (`test_features.py`, +1) — a subtlety the docstring already explained but nothing
tested; `find_similar_players` excludes the queried player, restricts to their position group, respects
`n`, and raises on an unknown player (`test_similarity.py`, +3) — previously zero coverage on the
function that actually powers the "players like X" lookup.

Tests **41 → 51 green**. CLAUDE.md's two test-count mentions updated to match (not doc-lint-enforced —
a repo fact, not a model output — but kept accurate manually).

**Ordering pass:** swapped `docs/FRAMEWORK.md`'s Target User table + Module B/A section order (was
B-then-A) to A-then-B; swapped `ML_LEARNING_LOG.md`'s section order (was A, C, B) to A, B, C;
reordered one Phase 4 table cell and one Phase 4 prose sentence in `INITIATIVE.md`/`ROADMAP.md` that
listed Module B before Module A. Left the FRAMEWORK.md recruitment walkthrough's B-then-A story order
alone — finding similar players before checking their xG is the actual workflow sequence, not a
labelling inconsistency.

## 2026-07-04 (cont.) — +8 more tests (determinism, zero-shot edge case, real-data sanity checks) + a real bug fix

Followed up on the parked test ideas from the previous entry.

**New `tests/test_data_sanity.py`** (6 tests, parametrized over `shots_train.parquet`/
`shots_test.parquet`): the one deliberate exception to "network-free, synthetic data only" — reads
the real cached shot tables and checks geometry stays within pitch bounds, no missing values in any
model-input feature column, and goal rate stays in a wide plausible band. Skips cleanly (not fails)
wherever `data/` isn't present, e.g. CI or a fresh clone.

**Determinism test** (`test_models.py`, +1): fitting the logistic pipeline twice on identical data
must give identical coefficients — guards against a future stochastic-solver swap silently breaking
reproducibility.

**Zero-shot-match edge case** (`test_features.py`, +1) **found a real bug**: `extract_shot_features`
crashed on a synthetic match with zero Shot events, because `shot_body_part`/`shot_type`/
`shot_outcome`/`shot_key_pass_id` were still bare column accesses — the same sparse-column crash
shape as the Barcelona 2020/21 fix, one level sparser (missing because the match has no shots at
all, not just a missing flag on an existing shot). Fixed by routing all four through the existing
`safe_column` helper. Not yet hit by real data (StatsBomb matches essentially always have ≥1 shot),
but worth fixing now that ~2,400 Phase 4 matches make it not-quite-negligible, and the edge-case test
found it before production data did.

Tests **51 → 59 green**; CLAUDE.md's two test-count mentions updated. Logged in
[ML_LEARNING_LOG.md](../ML_LEARNING_LOG.md). `src/features.py` changed (the fix); everything else
docs/tests only. Committed as part of `1c8d90d`.

## 2026-07-04 (cont.) — Phase 8 minimal build: app.py + app_data.py, jumped ahead of strict phase order

Agreed plan going into this: prioritise a minimal Streamlit build for the ~2026-07-11 friend demo
over finishing Phase 4b/4c first, since the demo needs "something clickable" and the earlier
smoke-test showed more league volume wasn't the highest-value next step anyway.

**New `src/app_data.py`** (`python -m src.app_data`): the offline build step — writes three small
Parquet artifacts to `app_data/` (committed, ~520KB total, no Git LFS needed): `player_per90.parquet`
(per-90 features + a K=4 style-archetype `cluster` label per position group), `player_xg_table.parquet`
(`build_player_xg_table` output), `shots_with_xg.parquet` (shots + predicted xG for the shot map).
Scoped to Premier League 2015/16 (`config.SIMILARITY_SET`) — the one dataset with a full similarity
*and* xG pool already computed; the spec's multi-competition sidebar pickers are a later pass, not v1.

**New `app.py`**: sidebar (position group → player → radar-axis multiselect) drives a radar chart,
a "players like X" ranking (`find_similar_players`), a finishing over/under panel (goals/xG/diff +
shot map), and an "under the hood" expander — reads `metrics.json` directly for headline numbers
plus a live (`st.cache_data`-cached) per-group silhouette curve, skipping a fourth precomputed
artifact just for the methodology plots. `.streamlit/config.toml` themes it (accent colour matches
the radar chart's own blue). `streamlit==1.58.0` pinned in `requirements.txt`.

**Verification, and its limits:** no browser tool available in this session, so verified headless via
Streamlit's own `AppTest` harness (`streamlit.testing.v1`) instead of skipping verification — ran the
full script for all 3 position groups, 8 different players (including one with zero logged shots, to
exercise the "no shot data" info branch, and one with an accented name, "Aleksandar Mitrović"), and the
zero-radar-axes edge case; zero exceptions across every combination. **This confirms script-level
correctness, not visual correctness** — the actual rendering hasn't been eyeballed in a browser yet;
say so plainly rather than claim more than was checked. `streamlit run app.py` locally is the
remaining step before trusting the visual layout.

Tests unaffected (59 green, unrelated to app.py/app_data.py). Docs updated: PRODUCT_SPEC.md's Build
Checklist (mostly checked off — deploy is the one step left, needs Guilherme's own Streamlit Cloud
account), ROADMAP.md/INITIATIVE.md's Phase 8 status, CLAUDE.md's Current Status + Repository Layout.
Archived the two oldest same-day entries below (docs pass, doc-style cleanup — already committed via
`ce45e74`) into PROGRESS_ARCHIVE.md, since this file was well past the 150-line threshold.

**Next: deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud (Guilherme's step), then decide Phase 4b/4c scope.**
Committed as part of `7f7a4e4`.

## 2026-07-05 — first real use of the app: two bugs found (not model bugs), then a UX pass

**Two real bugs, found by Guilherme actually running the app** (both environment/tooling, not a
model or logic bug): (1) Streamlit's first-run "Welcome" email prompt blocks the terminal silently
on a machine's very first `streamlit run` — pre-answered via `~/.streamlit/credentials.toml`.
(2) My own `.streamlit/config.toml` had `headless = true`, meant for deployment, which silently
stopped `streamlit run app.py` from auto-opening a browser locally. Removed it. A third non-bug:
Guilherme was launching `app.py` via VS Code's Run button, which invokes plain `python`, not
`streamlit run` — bare mode, no server, no browser, just harmless warnings. All three logged in
[ML_TOOLING.md](ML_TOOLING.md).

**UX pass on first feedback** (search, more stats, "expect more to come"): replaced the two-step
sidebar position→player flow with one global, prominent search box (Streamlit's own selectbox
already filters live while typing — no new dependency); added per-position "signature stats" (3
role-relevant per-90 metrics with percentile rank — defender/midfielder/forward each get a
different trio) and a full 9-stat table with percentiles in an expander. Found and fixed a real
Streamlit gotcha along the way: a selectbox whose `options` list changes (the search box, narrowed
by the position filter) needs an explicit `key` tied to what changes it, or Streamlit tries to carry
a now-invalid selection forward and raises a raw `KeyError` from its own session-state internals —
keyed it on the filter value so the widget resets cleanly instead. Verified headless via `AppTest`
across every position filter × several players again after each fix.

Named, not silently skipped: true SofaScore-depth stats (completion %, duels won %) need new
features from raw events (a denominator, not just a different chart) — flagged in the app itself
and in PRODUCT_SPEC.md, not faked with today's counts-only data.

Docs: PRODUCT_SPEC.md "Post-v1 additions" section, ML_TOOLING.md (+2 gotchas). Tests unaffected
(59 green — none cover `app.py` itself, per Phase 8's presentation-shell scope). Committed as part
of `7f7a4e4`.

## 2026-07-05 (cont.) — goalkeeper feature engineering + a World Cup 2026 backlog note

Two asks that arrived mid-session: add goalkeepers to Module B, and note a 2026 World Cup
predictive-model idea for later.

**Goalkeepers:** investigated StatsBomb's `Goal Keeper` event schema on real cached data before
writing anything (`goalkeeper_type` values across 15 matches: Shot Faced, Shot Saved [+3 rarer
synonyms], Goal Conceded, Collected, Punch, Keeper Sweeper). New `extract_goalkeeper_match_actions`
+ `build_goalkeeper_per90_features` (`src/similarity.py`) give keepers their own feature set —
shots faced, saves, goals conceded, claims, punches, sweeper actions per 90, plus `save_pct` — kept
deliberately separate from the outfield `ACTION_COLUMNS` rather than a branch inside the same
function (a keeper's tackle/pass-progression rate is meaningless; same "cluster per position
group" lesson as S6, one step further). Refactored the shared match-iteration loop out of
`build_player_per90_features` into `_build_season_minutes_and_actions` so both builders reuse it —
verified byte-identical output for the existing outfield function before trusting the refactor.
+2 tests (`test_similarity.py`). Verified on real PL 2015/16 data: 27 keepers clear the 900-minute
floor, recognisable names (Čech, de Gea, Lloris, Courtois, Schmeichel). One honest caveat found by
actually looking at the numbers: `save_pct` (25-51%) reads lower than the broadcast "save %" stat
(usually 65-75%) — likely because StatsBomb's `Shot Faced` count isn't restricted to shots on
target. Documented in MODULES.md rather than hidden or asserted-correct without checking.

**Not done in this pass, on purpose:** wiring goalkeepers into `config.py`, clustering (own K?),
or the app's position filter — a separate integration decision, not rushed into the same pass as
the feature engineering.

**World Cup 2026 note:** added to ROADMAP.md/INITIATIVE.md's Phase 9 backlog — flagged that the
first step has to be checking whether StatsBomb has released *any* open data for it yet, since
every tournament this project already uses was released after the tournament ended, not live, and
the 2026 World Cup may still be running. Scope (target, features, train set) deliberately left
undefined until that's checked.

Tests **59 → 61 green**. `src/similarity.py` + `tests/test_similarity.py` changed; docs updated
(MODULES.md, ML_LEARNING_LOG.md, ROADMAP.md, INITIATIVE.md, CLAUDE.md test count). Committed as
part of `29f753f`.

## 2026-07-05 (cont.) — round 2 first-use feedback: real search, dark theme, defender stats, and Phase 4b actually wired in

Four asks in one message: the round-1 search still didn't read as "typing search," why the app is
locked to one 2015/16 league, a dark teal/gray + orange/blue theme, and assists/clearances still
not visible for a player.

**Real typing search:** swapped the round-1 `st.selectbox` for an `st.text_input` that narrows a
match list once committed, feeding a selectbox of current matches with the top one pre-selected —
the text box is now the obvious first thing to type into, not a dropdown you click open before
typing. (Correction added 2026-07-06: this does not rerun on every keystroke the way this entry
originally said — `st.text_input` needs Enter or a blur to commit; caught by actually driving the
app with Playwright, see ML_TOOLING.md.)

**Phase 4b actually wired in:** the app's player pool now spans `config.SIMILARITY_SETS` — PL/La
Liga/Serie A/Ligue 1 2015/16 + Frauen Bundesliga/FA WSL 2023/24 — **1,511 players** (up from 300),
clustered together per position group in `src/app_data.py`. Verified: typing "Kan" now surfaces
Kanté, Kane, Kankava, Kana-Biyik, Zukanović, Rytting-Kaneryd and Mbokani across 4 different
competitions in one search. Named the real ceiling explicitly rather than just widening quietly:
StatsBomb's free data has no recent men's top-flight season at all (2015/16 is the cap for all
four men's leagues here), so this is "wider," not "newer," for the men's side — the women's
leagues (2023/24) are the newest full-season data anywhere in this project. **No cross-league
normalisation yet** — flagged in the app's "players like X" panel and "Under the hood" expander as
a coarser signal than a same-league match, matching Phase 4b's original open item rather than
quietly resolving it.

**Dark theme:** `.streamlit/config.toml` repainted (`base="dark"`, orange primary, teal/gray
backgrounds); `app.py` mirrors the palette in matplotlib rcParams (figure/axes backgrounds, text,
grid, a custom orange/blue property cycle) so charts match the surrounding chrome. `plot_player_radar`
gained optional dark-friendly colour params (default unchanged — notebooks/pipeline PNGs unaffected).
**Not visually verified in a browser** — no screenshot tool available this session; verified via
Streamlit's headless `AppTest` harness only (script-level correctness). Asked Guilherme to eyeball
`streamlit run app.py` before calling the look done.

**Assists + defender stats:** `assists_p90` promoted into Midfielder/Forward signature stats (it
was already computed, just buried in the stat expander); new `clearances`/`blocks` action columns
(`ACTION_COLUMNS` 9→11) for Defender's signature stats. Checked StatsBomb's real `Clearance`/`Block`
event schema on cached data first — no goal-line-specific sub-type exists, so a plain clearance
count is the honest available proxy, stated as such in the app and MODULES.md.

**A real bug found along the way, not by production data:** the new clearances/blocks test exposed
that `extract_player_match_actions`'s zero-completed-passes fallback built a shapeless empty Series
(plain `RangeIndex` instead of the `(player, team)` `MultiIndex` every other action Series carries
even when empty) — corrupted `pd.concat`'s output shape whenever it was the only all-empty column.
Fixed by deriving the empty case the same way as everywhere else in the function. Unreachable with
real StatsBomb matches (always have passes), but a real landmine. See ML_LEARNING_LOG.md.

**Housekeeping:** regenerated `metrics.json` (silhouette shifted slightly for the new feature count,
e.g. defender 0.236→0.223 — same "soft continuum" finding, doc-lint test still green) and the
pipeline's cached per-90 pickle, so neither silently serves stale 9-column data. **Not done:**
re-executing notebook 03 — its saved cluster/neighbour tables were computed on 9 features and are
now a snapshot of the last real run, not current code; deferred rather than rushed, since the
clustering outcome could shift enough (which players land in which cluster) to need a careful
narrative re-check, not just a mechanical re-run.

Tests **61 → 65 green**. Full pytest suite + a headless `AppTest` smoke script covering typing
search, competition filter, and all 3 position groups, all green.

**Also raised, not yet addressed:** wanting all La Liga data available (not just the one full
season — the 16 Barcelona-only seasons are pulled but not wired in) and a new "player career" page
with multi-season drill-down + international-tournament stats + trophies/individual awards/MOTMs.
The last part doesn't exist in any current data source (StatsBomb has no honours/awards data at
all) — scoping this with Guilherme rather than guessing at it. Committed as part of `428496f`.

## 2026-07-06 — real screenshots surfaced a real bug: radar chart stayed white; whole-number totals added

Guilherme finally saw the round-2 theme pass running (screenshots) and the dark theme was broken
in one specific place — the radar chart — plus two functional asks: raw counting stats (not
per-90 decimals) as the headline numbers, and more visually engaging charts.

**Real bug, root-caused not patched around:** mplsoccer's `Radar.setup_axis()` defaults
`facecolor='#FFFFFF'` and calls `ax.set_facecolor()` itself *after* the axes already had the
correct dark background from rcParams — silently overwriting it. Every other chart (silhouette
curve, etc.) was already fine, which is what made this one white chart suspicious rather than "the
whole theme is broken." Fixed by threading `circle_facecolor` through to `setup_axis()` too.
Verified by actually rendering a synthetic radar and reading the saved PNG's pixel RGB values
(`#12181a` at the axes region) rather than re-reading the code and assuming.

**Whole-number totals:** `build_player_per90_features` now keeps raw `ACTION_COLUMNS` season
totals alongside the `_p90` rates (both in the same table — no separate rebuild path). Signature
stat cards now lead with the season total (e.g. "29" goals) with the per-90 rate + percentile
moved into the hover tooltip. Sanity-checked against reality: Cristiano Ronaldo's 2015/16 La Liga
non-penalty-goal total came out to 29 (real total was 35 incl. penalties) — checks out.

**A second real bug found while touching this table:** the "All per-90 stats" table sorted on a
pre-formatted percentile *string* ("98th"/"9th"), which sorts lexically wrong for single- vs
double-digit values. Fixed by sorting on the numeric percentile before formatting for display.

**More visual interest, per the dataviz skill:** invoked it before touching any chart/stat-tile
code. "Players like X" was a plain dataframe — converted to a horizontal bar chart
(`plot_similar_players_bar`, new in `visualisation.py`): one hue (the app's orange accent) with an
opacity ramp for closeness, direct distance labels at each bar's tip, recessive gridlines — the
skill's "compare magnitude → bar, sequential" form, not a categorical palette, since each row is
one entity's distance, not several parallel series. Kept the old dataframe as a "Table view"
expander underneath (the skill's "every chart needs a table-view twin" rule).

Tests **65 green, unchanged** (no new src logic needing a test — `plot_similar_players_bar`
follows the existing convention of not unit-testing plotting functions; `build_player_per90_features`'s
new raw columns are exercised by the full suite passing unchanged). `app_data/player_per90.parquet`
rebuilt (1,511 players, unchanged counts — just wider columns) and re-verified via the `AppTest`
headless smoke script.

**Answered, not yet actioned:** whether 2015/16 across the four men's leagues is "for
normalisation" — no, it's StatsBomb's actual data ceiling (that's the *only* full season available
for each), not a deliberate choice; and yes, real data is still on the table — the 16 Barcelona-only
La Liga seasons (2004/05–2020/21) are pulled (events) but not wired in (no lineups yet), which is
the direct lever for multi-season "career" depth already under discussion.

---

## 2026-07-06 (cont.) — got real browser eyes on the app; new feedback logged as backlog, not built

Guilherme asked whether "Chrome headless + screenshots" (a technique a friend uses) makes sense
for Claude Code, since he suspected it might be terminal-only by design.

**It works, and it's now a documented capability.** Not a hard limitation — terminal access plus
an image-capable file-read tool is enough once something puts a real screenshot on disk. Getting
there took two wrong turns, both logged in [ML_TOOLING.md](ML_TOOLING.md): plain
`msedge --headless --screenshot` only ever captured Streamlit's loading skeleton (it waits for
the page `load` event, but Streamlit's content arrives after that, over a WebSocket); Playwright
fixed the waiting problem but its own browser download failed on this machine (Avast HTTPS
interception, the same class of issue as the earlier `certifi` gotcha) — worked around by pointing
Playwright at the already-installed Edge (`channel="msedge"`) instead of downloading one.

**Used it to actually verify the previous round's fixes** — confirmed via real screenshots (not
just re-reading the diff) that the radar chart's dark background genuinely renders now, signature
stats show whole numbers, and the "players like X" bar chart's colour ramp is correct (checked
actual pixel RGB values: closest match = full accent orange, fading toward the background for
farther matches).

**Found one real inaccuracy while poking at it further:** the app's search box does not rerun on
every keystroke the way earlier session comments/docs claimed — `st.text_input` needs Enter or a
blur to commit (it shows its own "Press Enter to apply" hint). Corrected the claim in `app.py`,
`docs/PRODUCT_SPEC.md`, and the placeholder text; left already-dated PROGRESS_ARCHIVE.md entries
alone (append-only history records what was believed at the time, same policy as the old 0.798
xG figure). The underlying UX (type a name, hit Enter, get filtered results) is unaffected — only
the "how it works" description was wrong, not the behaviour itself.

**New feedback captured as backlog, deliberately not built tonight** (Guilherme's own call —
"save all that for next session"): a sortable all-players leaderboard with goals *including*
penalties (so outliers like Sergio Ramos's penalty count show up) and visible xG where available;
the "Under the hood" methodology expander flagged as low-value/under review pending more charts;
goalkeepers still not wired into the app (feature engineering has existed since 2026-07-05); and
clickable "similar player" names for recursive drill-down (his message was cut off after "but" —
there was an unstated caveat, needs confirming before building). Full detail in
[PRODUCT_SPEC.md](PRODUCT_SPEC.md)'s new "Backlog from 2026-07-06 feedback" section.

Tests **65 green, unchanged** — only doc/comment accuracy fixes this pass, no behaviour change.

---

## 2026-07-06 (cont. 2) — shipped the player leaderboard (backlog item #1) + goals-incl-penalties column

Picked up the 2026-07-06 backlog. Of the five deferred items, the **all-players leaderboard** was
the only one with no blocker — goalkeepers still need a clustering/K design call, and the clickable
drill-down is blocked on an unfinished "but..." caveat from the last feedback message. Built it end
to end.

**New display-only `goals` column (incl. penalties).** The whole point of the leaderboard (per
Guilherme: spot penalty-inflated tallies like a centre-back topping the goals list) needs a goal
total *with* penalties — which didn't exist. `ACTION_COLUMNS`' `non_penalty_goals` strips them on
purpose (penalties convert ~100%, so counting them in the similarity features would just reward
penalty-takers as scoring skill). Added `goals` to `extract_player_match_actions` and a new
`DISPLAY_COUNT_COLUMNS = ["goals"]` constant threaded through `build_player_per90_features` —
kept deliberately *out* of `ACTION_COLUMNS`/`PER90_FEATURE_COLUMNS`, so it never enters
clustering / PCA / radar / percentiles, only the human-readable table. No `_p90` rate for it (a
"penalty-goals per 90" stat nobody asked for). New unit test locks the split in
(`goals` counts a penalty, `non_penalty_goals` doesn't).

**Leaderboard view in `app.py`.** A sidebar `View` radio toggles Player explorer ↔ Leaderboard;
the leaderboard branch renders after the shared position/competition filters and `st.stop()`s
before any player-only widget, so it's a minimal-diff addition, not a re-indent of the existing
page. `render_leaderboard` shows one sortable `st.dataframe` (Player/Team/Competition/Position/
Minutes/Goals/Non-pen goals/Assists) left-joined to the flagship xG table for `xG`/`G-xG` —
**blank, not faked**, for the ~2/3 of the pool outside Module A's training set, same honesty as
the single-player finishing panel. `st.column_config.NumberColumn` keeps columns numeric (so
header-click sort is real) while formatting ints/`%+.1f`. Default sort Goals desc.

**Verified headless** (rebuilt `app_data`, then AppTest drove the Leaderboard view: 1511 rows, no
exception, sorted Goals-desc). Data sanity-checked against reality: Suárez tops La Liga 2015/16 at
40, Ronaldo 35 goals / 29 non-pen (6 pens — matches the earlier CR7 check), and Fabinho surfaces
as a **defender with 6 goals, all penalties** — the exact Sergio-Ramos-style outlier the feature
was built to expose. **Not yet eyeballed in a real browser** — low risk (stock `st.dataframe`, not
custom matplotlib), worth a glance next session before deploy.

Tests **66 green** (65 + the new penalty-split test). `app_data/player_per90.parquet` rebuilt
(1511 players, unchanged count — one new column). Backlog items #2 (xG in a broad view) folded in
here; #3 methodology expander, #4 goalkeepers, #5 clickable drill-down still open.

---

## 2026-07-08 — real-browser verification of both app views; "black screen" is environment, not code

Guilherme reported running `streamlit run app.py` locally and seeing "nothing but a black screen,"
and asked for a last real-browser peek + a docs sweep before the next session.

**Drove the running app with Playwright-over-Edge** (the documented ML_TOOLING.md recipe:
`channel="msedge"`, tall viewport, wait for WebSocket content) and screenshotted both views:
- **Player explorer** renders correctly — dark theme, sidebar controls, dark radar chart, orange
  "players like X" bar chart, signature-stat cards, finishing panel (checked live on Aaron
  Cresswell). No exception, no white/black chart.
- **Leaderboard** renders correctly — sortable table, Goals-desc default (Suárez 40, Zlatan/Higuaín
  36, Ronaldo 35/29), xG populated only for Premier League players (Kane 20.8, Agüero 17.5, Vardy
  20.7) and `None` elsewhere, exactly as designed.

**Conclusion: the app is not broken.** The black screen is a client-side/environment issue on
Guilherme's machine, not a code bug — the same server renders fine to headless Edge here. Most
likely Streamlit's content never arrived over its WebSocket (content is delivered *after* the page
`load` event; if the WebSocket is blocked — Avast web-shield on localhost, a stale cached tab, or
looking before it connected — the dark page shell shows with no content). Suggested fixes for next
run: hard-refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R), try another browser, confirm the `streamlit run` process is still
alive and the right `localhost` URL is open, and temporarily disable Avast's web shield. Logged as
an environment gotcha in [ML_TOOLING.md](ML_TOOLING.md).

**Minor cosmetic noted, not changed:** blank xG cells render as the literal `None` (Streamlit shows
`NaN` in a `NumberColumn` that way) rather than a dash — honest and explained in the caption, but a
candidate polish later. No code change this pass; verification + docs only, tests still **66 green**.

---

## 2026-07-09 — Phase 4c mostly done: Module A generalisation across 3 of 4 held-out tournaments

Picked up the model-track backlog (not the app UX one): Phase 4c was the one remaining open item
in Phase 4 — Copa América 2024, FIFA World Cup 2022, and Africa Cup of Nations 2023 were pulled
back on 2026-07-04 but never scored against the trained xG model, leaving EURO 2024 as the only
held-out generalisation evidence anywhere in the docs.

**Design call: report per-tournament, don't pool.** `config.TEST_SETS` (still `[EURO_2024]`) and
the headline `0.765` test ROC-AUC every doc quotes are untouched on purpose — folding four
structurally different tournaments (a settled European field, a smaller CONMEBOL sample, a
different tactical culture, etc.) into one aggregate number would answer a coarser question than
the honest one Phase 4c actually asks: does the model generalise *evenly*? New
`config.GENERALISATION_TEST_SETS` (EURO 2024 + the three Phase 4 tournaments) is scored
separately per competition by a new `models.evaluate_by_competition` (fits once on `TRAIN_SETS`,
then slices the combined held-out table by `competition_id`), assembled into
`metrics.json`'s new `xg_generalisation` section by `metrics.compute_generalisation_metrics`, and
plotted by a new `visualisation.plot_xg_generalisation_bar` (invoked the dataviz skill first: a
magnitude comparison across a handful of named categories is a single-hue bar chart, not a
categorical palette — direct ROC-AUC labels at each tip, a dashed no-skill/0.5 reference line,
sample size folded into the label itself since a small held-out sample is exactly the caveat that
shouldn't be missable). `pipeline.py` gained a `build_generalisation_table` step (same
cache-or-rebuild pattern as the existing shot tables) and now writes
`outputs/xg_generalisation_by_tournament.png`; `manifest.py`'s default dataset list now includes
the three new tournaments too (deduped against `TEST_SETS`, since `GENERALISATION_TEST_SETS`
overlaps it on `EURO_2024`).

**The actual finding is a good one, not just a wiring exercise:** EURO 2024 (0.765) turns out to be
the *floor*, not a fluke — the same model scores 0.808 on FIFA World Cup 2022, 0.807 on Africa Cup
of Nations 2023, and 0.763 on Copa América 2024 (751 shots, the smallest sample of the four, flagged
as such). The honest story sharpens from "the model holds up reasonably on one tournament" to "the
model holds up as well or better everywhere tested" — a stronger generalisation claim than the
single EURO 2024 number alone supported, and worth surfacing over README's/CLAUDE.md's headline
number rather than replacing it.

**Women's EURO 2025 stays unwired — a real rate limit, not a data problem.** Attempted the pull
(never previously cached, unlike the other three) and hit persistent `429 Too Many Requests` from
`raw.githubusercontent.com` on the first or second match across several retries spaced minutes
apart — this didn't clear the way the one-off `IncompleteRead` from the original Phase 4 pull did.
Left genuinely unwired rather than forcing it or guessing at a fix; logged in
[ML_TOOLING.md](ML_TOOLING.md). The resumable per-match cache means a later session's retry picks
up wherever this one stopped, at no extra cost.

Notebook 02 is deliberately untouched — same precedent as Phase 4a/4b (the notebook stays the
fixed single-competition/single-tournament teaching example; the wider multi-dataset checks live in
`src`/`metrics.json`/`pipeline.py` only). +6 tests (`evaluate_by_competition`,
`compute_generalisation_metrics`, `build_metrics`'s new optional section, `build_generalisation_table`'s
cache logic) — **72 green** (66 → 72). Full `python -m src.pipeline` run regenerated `metrics.json`
and `data/manifest.json` against real data (not synthetic-only tests) — every dataset now shows
`n_cached_locally == n_matches`, confirming no partial/rate-limited state leaked into what's
actually wired in.

**Status language corrected same session** (Guilherme flagged it): calling Phase 4/4c "✅ Done"
overstated it while Women's EURO 2025 stays unwired — downgraded to 🟡 "3/4 tournaments wired"
across CLAUDE/INITIATIVE/ROADMAP/this file. **One further retry attempt, later the same session**
(time-boxed per an explicit "don't waste time on it" ask): still `429`, and this time even
`sb.matches()` (metadata, not an event pull) was already rate-limited — a broader block than the
first attempt showed. Stopped after one try; logged in [ML_TOOLING.md](ML_TOOLING.md). Status
unchanged: still 3/4, still resumable for free whenever the limit clears.

## 2026-07-09 (cont.) — Phase 8 deployed to Streamlit Community Cloud (Phase 8 now fully ✅)

Same-day continuation, ahead of the ~2026-07-11 friend demo. Guilherme deployed `app.py` himself
via Streamlit Community Cloud's "New app" flow; I verified beforehand that the repo was actually
ready (pinned `requirements.txt`, committed `app_data/*.parquet`, no secrets needed since the app
reads only static local artifacts, no live StatsBomb pulls at runtime) and flagged one real risk in
the deploy form: `app.py` imports `src.similarity` → `src.data_loader`, which imports `kloppy` at
module level even though the app itself never calls it — `kloppy` is the heaviest/least-common
dependency in `requirements.txt`, so a build failure would likely start there.

**Set Python version to 3.10 in the deploy's advanced settings, overriding Cloud's 3.14 default.**
Every pinned dependency was tested against 3.10 locally; deploying on a newer interpreter risked
missing wheels for `kloppy`/`pyarrow`/`statsbombpy`, forcing an unplanned dependency-bump-and-
reverify right before the demo for zero functional gain. Recommended *against* actually modernising
the project's Python target for the same reason when Guilherme asked — added as a low-priority
Phase 9 opportunistic backlog item instead (see ROADMAP.md), explicitly not now.

**Live at [gpfootball-analytics-portfolio.streamlit.app](https://gpfootball-analytics-portfolio.streamlit.app)**,
confirmed rendering correctly by Guilherme in a real browser — the strongest verification yet,
stronger than the local Playwright-over-Edge check from 2026-07-08. README now links it at the top
next to the CI badge. Phase 8 is now fully ✅ done; the only work left in the whole initiative is
Phases 5–7 and the small app-UX backlog in CLAUDE.md's Current Status.

## 2026-07-09 (cont. 3) — doc-freshness enforcement: a git hook + CI backstop, not just a rule

Guilherme caught, twice in the same session, that the "log obstacles/findings as they happen"
convention in CLAUDE.md's Session Workflow was being followed inconsistently (a retry attempt went
unlogged; doc edits sat uncommitted) — then asked for an actual **mechanism**, not just a
restatement of the rule, since relying on memory had just visibly failed.

**Built two backstops, deliberately not just more prose in CLAUDE.md:**
- `.githooks/pre-commit` — blocks a commit touching `src/`/`app.py`/`tests/`/`notebooks/` unless
  the commit also touches `docs/PROGRESS.md`, `docs/ML_TOOLING.md`, or `ML_LEARNING_LOG.md`.
  Escape hatch for real trivial commits: `DOC_CHECK_ACK=1 git commit ...` (kept distinct from
  `--no-verify`, which would skip every hook, not just this one check).
- `.github/workflows/tests.yml`'s new "Check evolving docs were touched" step — the same check
  against the push/PR diff, as a non-blocking `::warning::` annotation, so the mechanism still
  fires even if the local hook was never enabled (a fresh clone doesn't auto-activate hooks).

**Enabling the hook is itself a persistence decision, not a passive doc edit** — the sandbox's own
auto-mode classifier correctly paused on `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` (a mechanism that
runs on every future commit, not just this session) until Guilherme explicitly confirmed enabling
both. Verified all three code paths actually work before relying on them: a code-only staged change
correctly blocks (exit 1, printed the exact violating files); `DOC_CHECK_ACK=1` correctly overrides
(exit 0); staging a real log-file touch alongside the code change correctly passes (exit 0) —
tested via scratch edits to `src/config.py`, fully reverted after, not left staged or committed.

Documented in `CLAUDE.md`'s Session Workflow ("This is enforced, not just requested") rather than
just added silently — the point is that a future session (or a human contributor) can see *why*
a blocked commit is happening, not just hit a wall.

---

## 2026-07-09 (cont. 4) — Penalty info on the player page (backlog item #4 shipped)

Shipped the smallest of the four open items from `PRODUCT_SPEC.md`'s "Backlog from 2026-07-06
feedback": the single-player "Player explorer" page showed only `non_penalty_goals`, so a
penalty-taker's page looked like it had no penalty data even though the leaderboard's `goals`
total (incl. penalties) already existed. Presentation-only, no data/rebuild work, as anticipated —
`penalties = goals - non_penalty_goals`, both columns already on `player_row_full`.

Added a `st.caption` right under the existing "Season totals..." caption (`app.py`, after the
signature-stats metric-card loop): `"Goals (incl. penalties): {total}{penalty_note}"`, only
rendered when `total_goals > 0` (skips the line entirely for non-scorers rather than showing a
"0 goals, 0 from penalties" line on every defender/GK page).

Verified end-to-end, not just unit-tested: ran `streamlit run app.py` locally and drove it with
the Playwright-over-Edge recipe from `ML_TOOLING.md` (system Edge via `channel="msedge"`, since
`playwright install chromium` still fails on this machine). Confirmed Fallou Diagne (Rennes,
`goals=5`, `non_penalty_goals=3`) renders `"Goals (incl. penalties): 5 (2 from penalties)"`, and a
true zero-goal player (Abdul Rahman Baba, Chelsea) shows no such line. Screenshot matched — caption
sits directly under the signature-stat cards as the backlog entry expected. Full `pytest` suite
(72 tests) still green — no test coverage existed for `app.py` itself (a Streamlit script, not a
`src/` module), so this was verified live, not via the suite.

Three items remain open in the backlog: clickable "similar player" drill-down, goalkeepers wired
into the app, and the "Under the hood" methodology expander rework (still explicitly on hold).

---

## 2026-07-09 (cont. 5) — Clickable "similar player" drill-down (backlog item shipped), and a real bug caught by actually clicking it

Shipped the second open backlog item: clicking a row in the "Players like X" → "Table view"
table now jumps the whole page to that player (radar, signature stats, similar-players list, xG
all recompute for the new player) instead of being a static, unclickable table.

**Mechanism** (`app.py`): a row click sets `st.session_state["jump_to_player"] = (player, team)`
and calls `st.rerun()`. A new block at the very top of the script — before any widget is
created — checks for that key and, if present, pre-seeds the sidebar position/competition
filters, the search box, and the player-picker selectbox's session_state so the next run lands
directly on the target player with no stale filter hiding them. This is the only point Streamlit
allows a script to set a widget's value programmatically: session_state for a widget's `key` must
be written *before* that widget's `st.xxx(key=...)` call in the same run.

**A real bug, caught only by actually driving the click with Playwright, not by reading the code:**
the first version gave the "Table view" dataframe a fixed `key="similar_table"`. Streamlit
persists a dataframe's row-selection state in session_state by key across reruns — so after
landing on the new player's page, the *same* key's table rendered with row 0 still marked
selected from the previous click, which immediately re-triggered another jump to whoever *that*
player's own most-similar match was, cascading indefinitely. Static analysis / reading the diff
would not have caught this — it only showed up as visibly inconsistent, non-settling page state
under a real click. Fixed by scoping the key to the current player/team
(`key=f"similar_table_{player_name}_{team_name}"`), so each player's table is a fresh widget
instance with no carried-over selection. Re-verified after the fix: clicked twice in a row
(Fallou Diagne → Aïssa Mandi → back to Fallou Diagne, their mutual nearest match) and confirmed
the page settles to one consistent state each time rather than continuing to jump.

Verified live end-to-end via `streamlit run app.py` + the Playwright-over-Edge recipe
(`ML_TOOLING.md`) — canvas-based `st.dataframe` grids aren't clickable via normal DOM locators
(no real `<input>`/`<summary>` elements; row selection and the expander toggle are drawn on
`canvas`, testid `data-grid-canvas`), so verification clicked raw pixel coordinates inside the
canvas bounding box rather than a semantic locator. Full `pytest` suite (72 tests) green
throughout — no test coverage exists for `app.py` itself, this was live-verified only.

One open follow-up, not blocking: a fixed-key expander (`st.expander("Table view...")`, no `key=`)
appears to inherit its previous open/closed state across the jump in some cases and not others,
observed inconsistently during testing. Cosmetic only (worst case: expander shows collapsed after
a jump, one extra click to reopen) — not a correctness bug, not chased further this session.

---

## 2026-07-13 — Pitch-prep pass: app "About / how to use" banner, market-value data spike

Guilherme pitched the project to a colleague today; asked to review the backlog, prep pitch/
roadmap talking points, and make the live app more self-explanatory (a description of the
framework + how to use it, "máximo de informação possível") before the demo.

**Backlog reviewed, nothing shipped from it this session** (all three items are still open, on
purpose — see `PRODUCT_SPEC.md`'s "Backlog from 2026-07-06 feedback"): goalkeepers not wired into
the app, "Under the hood" methodology expander still flagged low-value/on hold, one cosmetic
expander-state follow-up from the drill-down work. Talking points and a demo script (leaderboard →
player explorer → similar-player click-through → finishing panel → credibility numbers →
roadmap) were prepared directly in chat, not saved as a repo doc — a one-off presentation aid, not
project documentation that needs maintaining.

**`app.py` gained a main-pane "About" banner**, rendered above both views (Player explorer and
Leaderboard) right after the sidebar title block: a one-line framework summary, a two-column
explanation of the two lenses (similarity/scouting, xG/valuation), a 4-tile `st.metric` row (xG
ROC-AUC, competition count, player count, test count — reusing the same metric-card idiom already
used for signature stats, not a new pattern), an expanded-by-default "How to use this app" 7-step
guide, and a GitHub link. Deliberately did **not** touch the existing "Under the hood" expander —
still explicitly on hold per the 2026-07-06 feedback backlog, and this pass's ask (more *framework*
explanation) doesn't supersede that hold, which was about *methodology plot* redesign specifically.

Verified live via `streamlit run app.py` + the Playwright-over-Edge recipe (`ML_TOOLING.md`):
screenshotted both views. First Leaderboard screenshot showed leaderboard content *and* stale
Player-explorer content both on screen at once — not a real bug, confirmed by re-shooting with a
longer post-click wait (4s vs. 2s): Streamlit doesn't prune trailing elements from the previous run
until the new run fully finishes, so a screenshot taken mid-transition can catch old + new content
overlapping. Worth remembering next time a click-driven verification looks inconsistent — wait
longer before concluding it's a product bug.

**Mid-session ask: could the app show market value next to similarity matches?** Researched rather
than guessed. Finding: a maintained, weekly-refreshed open dataset
([dcaribou/transfermarkt-datasets](https://github.com/dcaribou/transfermarkt-datasets), also on
Kaggle) has a dated `player_valuations` table — so the data itself isn't the blocker, contrary to
the instinctive assumption that this would need scraping from scratch. The real cost is matching
StatsBomb player identities to Transfermarkt's (no shared ID — a name-resolution problem: accents,
birth-name-vs-shirt-name, same-name collisions) plus picking the right valuation snapshot per
season and a ToS caveat (the upstream dataset is itself built by scraping, so legality is inherited
not cleared). Real engineering, not a config line — logged as a scoped future item, not built now:
see [DATA.md](DATA.md#market-value-transfermarkt--flagged-2026-07-13-not-started) for the full
assessment and [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) Phase 9 for the pointer.

No `src/`/model/test changes this session — presentation and docs only. Full `pytest` suite
untouched (still 72 green, not rerun since nothing in `src/` changed).

---

## 2026-07-13 (cont.) — "About & Roadmap" promoted to its own tab; headline numbers refactored off decimals

Follow-up feedback on the same day's pitch-prep pass, three asks: (1) the S1–S9 vs. Phase 0–9
numbering was genuinely confusing — clarified directly in `docs/ROADMAP.md` (a note right above
the S1–S9 table) rather than just re-explained in chat, since the next person to open that file
hits the same confusion; also wrote `docs/PITCH.md` so the pitch script has an actual file path.
(2) Keep "Under the hood" but make it less prominent, with suggestions for new sections. (3) A
feasibility read on doing this now vs. next session — answered "there's time, do it," plus:
promote the suggested "roadmap teaser" into its own full tab (an "About-me"-style project page),
and refactor every headline stat off decimal ML scores (ROC-AUC, silhouette) onto whole-number
counts — "I need to be able to justify these numbers," decimals only where the methodology
explaining them lives.

**`app.py` restructure:** the sidebar `view` radio gains a third option, **"About & Roadmap"**
(`render_about_and_roadmap`), replacing the previous always-on-every-page main-pane banner (which
repeated the same essay above both the Player explorer and Leaderboard views). That banner is now
a one-line caption pointing at the new tab instead. The new tab holds: the two-lens framework
explanation, a "What's been built" stat row, the FRAMEWORK.md worked example ("how the two lenses
combine"), the "How to use this app" guide, a plain-language "what's shipped / what's next"
summary, and a collapsed **"Methodology"** expander — the only place decimal stats live now,
each one explained inline (what ROC-AUC means, the baseline ladder, the per-tournament
generalisation table + `plot_xg_generalisation_bar` chart, i.e. the app's first use of that chart —
it existed in `metrics.json`/`src/visualisation.py` since Phase 4c but was never wired into the UI
before). The per-player "Under the hood" expander (bottom of the Player explorer page) is slimmed
to a one-line pointer at the new tab plus the one thing genuinely specific to that page: the
current position group's live silhouette curve.

**Headline numbers are now whole counts, not decimals:** "What's been built" shows Competitions
(6), Players in the pool (1,511), Shots evaluated (15,528 = 10,824 trained + 4,704 held-out across
4 tournaments), Tournaments tested on (4) — no ROC-AUC/silhouette figure appears outside the
Methodology expander anywhere in the app. `docs/PITCH.md` refactored the same way: a "Key numbers
to lead with" whole-number section, and the decimal ROC-AUC/generalisation-range numbers moved to
a new "Methodology backup — only if asked to justify the model" section.

**Backlog-only, not built** (explicit ask): a side-by-side two-player comparison view — logged in
`ROADMAP.md`'s Phase 9 opportunistic list, no code.

Verified live via `streamlit run app.py` + Playwright-over-Edge across all three views. Hit the
same stale-trailing-content timing artifact as the earlier pass today (switching to "About &
Roadmap" right after page load showed old Player-explorer content — shot map, old "Under the hood"
— still rendered below the new tab's content); confirmed harmless by re-shooting with a longer wait
(6s) both from a warm session and a fresh page load — clean either way. Full `pytest` suite still
**72 green** (no `src/` changes, only new imports of already-tested `visualisation.plot_xg_generalisation_bar`).

---

## 2026-07-13 (cont. 2) — Doc-hygiene pass: INITIATIVE.md's Log was duplicating PROGRESS_ARCHIVE.md

Guilherme flagged, before committing, that `INITIATIVE.md` seemed to carry the project's logs "in
full" and asked whether that was too heavy — he remembered a separate history file for that (there
isn't one by that name; he meant `PROGRESS_ARCHIVE.md`). Checked rather than assumed: `INITIATIVE.md`
was 203 lines, its "Log" section repeating the same milestones as full paragraphs already fully
covered, in more detail, in `PROGRESS_ARCHIVE.md` (which has no size cap of its own and was already
852 lines). Confirmed every dated INITIATIVE.md log entry has a matching, more detailed entry in
PROGRESS_ARCHIVE.md before trimming, so nothing was lost — genuine duplication, not two views of
different information.

**Trimmed `INITIATIVE.md`'s Log to a one-line-per-milestone index** (203 → 89 lines), each line
pointing at PROGRESS.md/PROGRESS_ARCHIVE.md for the narrative. Matches the file's own stated
purpose ("this is the where-are-we tracker," not a second history) and removes a two-logs-must-
stay-in-sync-by-hand failure mode.

Also asked to make sure all the relevant `.md` files were actually current, not just the ones
directly asked about — checked each:
- **`docs/ML_TOOLING.md`**: a real gap. This session hit the same Playwright-view-switch
  stale-content timing artifact twice (Leaderboard, then About & Roadmap) but it had only been
  written up in PROGRESS.md's narrative, not logged as the reusable tooling gotcha it actually is.
  Added a new entry (placed next to the existing Playwright-over-Edge recipe).
- **`ML_LEARNING_LOG.md`**: nothing to add — this session touched no `src/` code, no model, no
  data; that log is for modelling/data gotchas specifically, and there weren't any.
- **`CLAUDE.md`**: the "Next (open backlog)" line still called the "Under the hood" rework an open
  item — stale as of this session's own earlier work. Updated to mark it done, added the
  2026-07-13 pass to the Active Initiative narrative, and fixed two unrelated small drifts noticed
  while in there: the Repository Layout's test count said "61" (actually 72 — this number is
  deliberately excluded from the metrics.json doc-lint check per Phase 3b, so it can drift
  silently), and its one-line descriptions of `ROADMAP.md`/`PROGRESS.md`/`PROGRESS_ARCHIVE.md` were
  stale summaries from when those files held different content. Also added the new `PITCH.md` to
  the layout listing.
- **`docs/PRODUCT_SPEC.md`**: the "Under the hood... flagged as low-value, under review" backlog
  bullet was the exact item this session's earlier pass had already shipped — marked
  `[DONE 2026-07-13]` with what actually got built, matching the `[DONE ...]` convention the other
  backlog bullets in that same list already use.

No `src/`/test changes; full `pytest` suite re-run after all doc edits, still **72 green** (docs
can't break tests, verified rather than assumed).

---

## 2026-07-13 (cont. 3) — Goalkeepers wired into the app; Leaderboard copy expanded

Guilherme had a few hours left before the pitch and asked to attack the near-term backlog —
specifically anything that could visibly show up on screen, naming goalkeepers first — plus a
fuller Leaderboard description (it had 2-4 lines of small text) and a visual pass over every page,
backlog anything too big.

**Goalkeepers wired in, both layers.** `src/app_data.py` gained `_build_combined_gk_table`
(mirrors `_build_combined_similarity_table` but via `build_goalkeeper_per90_features`, same
`config.SIMILARITY_SETS` pool — no `config.py` change needed) and `build_app_artifacts` now
concatenates it onto the outfield table (`pd.concat` aligns columns automatically; outfield-only
columns are NaN on goalkeeper rows and vice versa). **124 goalkeepers** now in the pool (1,511 →
1,635 players total). `app.py` gained a 4th position-filter option, a `Goalkeeper` entry in
`SIGNATURE_STATS_BY_POSITION`, a `save_pct` caption where outfield players get the penalty
breakdown, and — the real restructuring — moved the `radar_axes` sidebar widget to render *after*
the player is picked (its options now depend on position group, which wasn't knowable at the old
call site) and introduced `position_feature_columns`/`position_action_columns` so the percentile
table, "All per-90 stats" expander, and `find_similar_players` call all branch correctly instead of
hardcoding the outfield columns. **Deliberately not clustered** — no K/silhouette decision made for
goalkeepers, so no style-archetype layer for them yet; "players like X" still works since
`find_similar_players` ranks by raw distance, not cluster membership.

**A real bug, caught by Streamlit's `AppTest` harness, not by reading the diff:**
`build_goalkeeper_per90_features` (written 2026-07-05) only returned `_p90` rate columns — unlike
the outfield builder, which always kept the raw season total *and* the rate. Invisible for over a
week because nothing had ever called it; the first goalkeeper pick in the app crashed with
`KeyError: 'saves'` in the signature-stats loop. Scripted `AppTest` against a real goalkeeper
selection (`position_filter=Goalkeeper` → pick the first match → check `.exception`) caught it in
seconds, far faster than a manual browser click-through would have. Fixed by adding
`GK_ACTION_COLUMNS` to the function's `keep_columns`, same pattern as the outfield builder — logged
in ML_LEARNING_LOG.md, since it's a data/feature-engineering gap, not a tooling one.

**Leaderboard page got a real description**, not just a caption: what the view is for (vs. the
Player explorer), a "what to look for" list per column (Goals vs. Non-pen goals, xG/G-xG, the new
Goalkeeper row's blank columns), replacing the previous 1-line caption.

**Full visual review, not just the goalkeeper path:** re-verified the Player explorer (a normal
outfield player, Harry Kane — zero regression from the radar-axes move), the Leaderboard (with the
Goalkeeper filter on), and the About & Roadmap tab (whole-number tiles auto-updated to 1,635
players) via Playwright-over-Edge. Nothing else needed fixing or backlogging this pass — the
Player explorer/Leaderboard/About & Roadmap trio already got a thorough pass earlier the same day.

**Self-inflicted hiccup, logged so it isn't repeated:** launched two overlapping
`python -m src.app_data` rebuilds without waiting for the first one to finish, which then
contended with each other for ~15 minutes before either produced output; killed both and ran one
clean invocation, which succeeded immediately after. Not an environment gotcha worth a
ML_TOOLING.md entry (self-inflicted by not waiting on the background task), but worth remembering:
wait for one rebuild to finish before starting another.

`config.py` untouched (reused `SIMILARITY_SETS` as-is); no new pytest tests added for the
`app_data.py`/`app.py` wiring itself, consistent with existing precedent (neither file has any test
coverage — `build_player_per90_features` itself is only exercised via monkeypatching in
`test_pipeline.py`, not a direct schema test). Full `pytest` suite re-run after the `similarity.py`
fix, still **72 green**.

---

## 2026-07-13 (cont. 4) — Visual/brand pass: Leaderboard filters, Player explorer intro, brand identity, About & Roadmap expansion

Same-day follow-up after the goalkeeper wiring below. Guilherme asked for four things: filter the
Leaderboard by name/position, improve the Player explorer page's intro, make the sidebar/page
headers more visually developed with an appealing icon/brand/slogan, and expand About & Roadmap
with the data used, the methods, and where the models are headed next.

**Leaderboard filters.** `render_leaderboard` (`app.py`) gained an in-page name search
(`st.text_input`) and a position `st.multiselect` (defaulting to all options) above the table —
additive to the sidebar's shared position/competition filters, not a replacement, since the
sidebar narrows the whole pool (shared with Player explorer) while these two are scoped to
Leaderboard browsing itself. Empty-selection and no-match states both handled (a warning, not a
crash).

**Player explorer intro.** The page previously opened straight into a bare search box with no
title or explanation at all. Now opens with a proper header + a short markdown paragraph naming
every panel on the page (signature stats, radar, "players like X," Finishing).

**Brand identity.** New `BRAND_ICON = "⚽"` / `SLOGAN = "Scout by data, not by reputation."`
constants, threaded through: the browser tab (`st.set_page_config(page_icon=...)`), a new
`render_page_header()` helper (title on the left, a small icon+slogan badge in the top-right —
used by the Leaderboard, Player explorer, and every per-player page), and a rebuilt sidebar (brand
header, two live `st.metric` quick-facts — Players, Competitions — computed from `per90`, not
hardcoded, a "New here? Start with About & Roadmap" pointer, and a GitHub source link).

**About & Roadmap expansion.** Two new always-visible sections: "Data used" (the actual
competitions/seasons feeding each model — similarity pool, xG training set, the 4 generalisation
tournaments, SkillCorner) and "How each model works" (plain-language K-means/Euclidean-distance/PCA
for similarity, logistic regression for xG). Both are prose/dataset-name content with no bare
decimals, so they don't collide with the whole-number-headline rule the "Methodology" expander
already follows (see the 2026-07-13 cont. 2 entry above for that rule's origin). The "what's next"
roadmap paragraph also grew a third tier, "**A third lens, not started**," naming Module C
(Performance Under Pressure) explicitly — it hadn't appeared anywhere in the app before this pass,
only in MODULES.md/ROADMAP.md.

**Verification:** a scripted `AppTest` pass over all three views plus both new Leaderboard filters
and a goalkeeper pick came back with no exceptions; Playwright-over-Edge screenshots of all three
pages confirmed the visual result matches intent (brand badge top-right of every header, sidebar
quick-facts, filters both populated and functional). Full `pytest` suite re-run, still **72
green** (no `src/` changes this pass, `app.py`-only).

---

## 2026-07-13 (cont. 5) — Doc-interdependency review + a real feature/visual pass: Style archetype panel, percentile charts, Leaderboard colour

Opened the "bigger visual + docs pass" flagged at the end of the previous session with the doc
review first, as asked, then carried straight into app work rather than stopping to check back in
— per the open-ended framing ("scope isn't decided yet... open with that discussion"), reading all
docs surfaced concrete findings worth just fixing, and the app work followed the same "more than
visual — add real sections" brief.

**Doc review, all 16 `.md` files read end-to-end.** The cross-reference discipline holds up well
overall (the `metrics.json` doc-lint, `INITIATIVE.md` as the sole phase-table source, the
theory/tooling/decisions three-way split are all still clean) — four concrete things weren't:
(1) **`README.md` contradicted itself** — the live-demo link at the top implies a deployed, widened
app, but the body still said "not yet deployed" / "Premier League 2015/16 for v1" (both true before
2026-07-05/07-09, stale since). Rewritten with the real numbers (6 competitions, 1,635 players incl.
124 goalkeepers, live URL) and the repo-structure/Tech Stack sections updated (added `streamlit`,
pointed the `docs/` subtree at CLAUDE.md's index instead of hand-duplicating 3 of 12 files).
(2) **`CLAUDE.md`'s own Repository Layout omitted `docs/PRODUCT_SPEC.md`** despite it being actively
maintained and linked from three other docs — added. (3) **`ARCHITECTURE.md`'s Four Layers/Import
Graph never mentioned `app_data.py`** — the whole Phase 8 product-layer build step was invisible in
the one doc whose job is "how the pieces fit together"; added it as a third orchestration entry
point alongside `pipeline.py`/`manifest.py`/`metrics.py`, verified its actual imports via grep rather
than assumed. Also fixed a stale "future Streamlit app" phrase in the same file — it's deployed.
(4) **Two cross-doc line-number anchors (`MODULES.md#L57`, `MODULES.md#L53`) had already drifted to
the wrong section** (both pointed at Module B content instead of Module C — a real, demonstrable
consequence of using line anchors across files that get edited) — replaced all four markdown-to-
markdown line anchors repo-wide with heading anchors, which don't drift and (unlike `#Lxx`) actually
resolve in GitHub's normal rendered-markdown view, not just its blob/source view.

**App: two new features (not just visual), reusing existing computed data — no new modelling.**
Consulted the dataviz skill before writing chart code, per this project's own established habit;
manually verified the resulting orange/blue diverging pair against the dark panel surface (WCAG
contrast 4.89/3.23 respectively — Python computed, since `node` isn't installed here to run the
skill's own validator script) and confirmed against the skill's own anti-patterns doc that blue↔
orange is an explicitly endorsed diverging pair (blue↔aqua is the one it rejects, both cool).

- **New `plot_diverging_bar`** (`src/visualisation.py`) — one shared horizontal-bar function for
  "how does this compare to a baseline, direction and magnitude both matter" reads, parameterised by
  a reference value (50 for a percentile read, 0 for a z-score read) rather than two near-duplicate
  functions.
- **Style archetype panel** (Player explorer, outfield players only): `app_data.py` has computed a
  K=4 style-archetype `cluster` label per player since Phase 4, and `profile_clusters`
  (`src/similarity.py`) has existed since the notebooks needed it to name clusters ("ball-winning
  destroyer," etc.) — neither was ever surfaced in the live app. Now every outfield player's page
  shows *why* their cluster is what it is (top over/under-indexed stats as z-scores, plotted), plus
  a "Browse this archetype" expander listing other same-cluster players, clickable via the same
  jump-to-player mechanism the "players like X" table already uses. Goalkeepers skip this section —
  they aren't clustered yet (unchanged, known backlog item).
- **Percentile chart**: the "All per-90 stats" expander's plain sortable dataframe is now a
  percentile bar chart first (same diverging-bar function, reference=50), with the original
  dataframe kept as a nested "Table view" — matching the "every chart needs a table-view twin"
  convention `plot_similar_players_bar` already established.
- **Leaderboard**: G-xG now has a diverging background colour (orange over-performers, blue
  under-performers) via a pandas Styler + a small custom `LinearSegmentedColormap` blended through
  the dark panel colour, guarded on `notna().any()` so an all-blank filter (e.g. La Liga alone,
  outside Module A's flagship set) doesn't crash `background_gradient`'s vmin/vmax.

**A real, now-thoroughly-investigated open cosmetic bug, not fixed:** blank xG/G-xG cells render as
the literal text "None" (flagged as "candidate polish" back on 2026-07-08). Tried three independent
fixes this session (nullable `Float64` dtype, `Styler.format(na_rep=...)`, dropping
`column_config`'s own `format=`), each verified live against a freshly-restarted server — none
changed the "None" text, though the second attempt did confirm the Styler's format spec drives
*real*-value display. Conclusion: this Streamlit version's grid hardcodes missing numeric cells to
"None" regardless of Styler/column_config settings. Logged in full in
[ML_TOOLING.md](ML_TOOLING.md), including a false-start note (a plain browser reload doesn't
guarantee a dev server picked up an on-disk change — a full process restart does).

**Verification:** full `pytest` suite green throughout (**72**, unchanged — no `src/` logic
changed beyond the additive `plot_diverging_bar`, which isn't unit-tested, matching this codebase's
existing precedent of not testing plotting functions). A scripted `AppTest` pass covered all four
position groups plus all three views, zero exceptions. Playwright-over-Edge screenshots (system
Edge, per the established recipe) confirmed the new archetype panel, percentile chart, and Leaderboard
colour all render correctly across a defender, a goalkeeper (correctly skips the archetype section),
and the Leaderboard view.

**Backlog, deliberately not built this session (needs new model/code work first — logged, not
built):** goalkeeper clustering (style-archetype panel above is outfield-only until that lands),
cross-league similarity normalisation, a side-by-side two-player comparison view, market-value
integration (blocked on entity resolution, not data), a multi-season "player career" view (needs
new lineups pulls for the Barcelona seasons or similar). All pre-existing Phase 9/backlog items,
unchanged in scope by this session — no new backlog items were identified beyond what INITIATIVE.md/
ROADMAP.md/PITCH.md already tracked.
